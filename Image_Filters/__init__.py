Description
-----------
The project was meant to be a test of the package functions in Github. In order to so, we created a project that was a photo filter function package using Python. The goal was to allow the user to take the package in order to add it to a greater function or to modify the function to allow users to add their own filters to the image. Furthermore, the function would allow users to input their own images in the functions.
